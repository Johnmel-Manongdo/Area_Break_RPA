# Area Break Robotic Process Automation

This is an automation bot built using UiPath to automate a specific task in Microsoft Excel, which involves breaking down a full address into different areas such as Barangay, Municipality, and Province. The bot is designed to extract the necessary information from the address column in an Excel file and split it into separate columns for Barangay, Municipality, and Province. By automating this process, it eliminates the need for manual data entry and ensures accurate and efficient data organization.
